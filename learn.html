	    	<h2>Chess rules</h2>
	    	<p>
	    		Chess is a two-player board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Chess is played by millions of people worldwide, both amateurs and professionals.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. The most powerful piece is the queen and the least powerful piece is the pawn. The objective is to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result in a draw in several ways.
			</p>

			<h2>Movements</h2>
			<div id="chessmoves">

				<img src="images/chessmoves.jpg" alt="chess pieces moves image">
				<h3>Moves of a king</h3>
				<p>
					The king moves one square in any direction. The king has also a special move which is called castling and involves also moving a rook
				</p>

				<h3>Moves of a rook</h3>
				<p>
					The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not leap over other pieces. Along with the king, the rook is involved during the king's castling move.
				</p>

				<h3>Moves of a bishop</h3>
				<p>
					The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over other pieces.
				</p>

				<h3>Moves of a queen</h3>
				<p>
					The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces.
				</p>

				<h3>Moves of a knight</h3>
				<p>
					The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
				</p>

				<h3>Moves of a pawn</h3>
				<p>
					The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied (black "●"s in the diagram); or the pawn may capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). The pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and pawn promotion.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="check">
				<h2>Check</h2>
				<p>
					When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave his own king in check.

					In casual games it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, however this is not required by the rules of the game, and is not usually done in tournaments.

				<h2>End of the game</h2>
				<h3>Win</h3>					
				<p>Games may be won in the following ways:</p>
				<h4>Checkmate</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Resignation</em> – either player may resign, conceding the game to the other player.[5] It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a truly hopeless position, and for this reason high level games rarely end with a checkmate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Loss on time</em> – in games with a time control, a player may also lose by running out of time, even with a much superior position.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Forfeit</em> – a player who cheats, or violates the laws of the game, or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament may be forfeited. In high level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).

				</p>
				<h3>Draw</h3>
				<p>Games may end in a draw in several ways:</p>
				<p>
					<em>Draw by agreement</em> - draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally players have been allowed to agree a draw at any time in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Stalemate</em> - the player whose turn it is to move is not in check, but has no legal move.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Threefold repetition of a position</em> - this most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The fifty-move rule</em> - if during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player may claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim may be verified by the arbiter if challenged. There are in fact several known endgames where it is theoretically possible to force a mate but which require more than 50 moves before the pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. These endings are rare, however, and few players study them in detail, so the fifty-move rule is considered practical for over the board play. Some correspondence chess organizations allow exceptions to the fifty-move rule.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Insufficient material</em> - a player may claim a draw if their opponent has insufficient material to checkmate, for example if the player has only the king left and the opponent has only the king and a bishop. Such a claim is only valid if checkmate is impossible.
