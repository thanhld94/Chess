	    	<p>
	    		I want to create a website for truman chess enthusiast. The basic function of this site is uploading chess games and able to share that game with friends. Users will be able to upload a PGN (Portable Game Notations) files or files that simmilar to that context, and will be able to watch that game move by move.
			</p>

			<p>
				Learning chess is also fascinating. There will be links, documents and posts about improving your chess level. Also, chess games that are made public can be viewed by other people. If it is possible, there will be a comment system so that players will able to help each other.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				The website could be extended to play chess against each other with a scoring system similar to other standard chess website. Students would be able to register with an truman email address (only?)

				Chess is believed to have originated in India, some time before the 7th century; the Indian game of chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of xiangqi and shogi. The pieces took on their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were finally standardized in the 19th century.
